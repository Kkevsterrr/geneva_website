# Censorship Evasion

Researchers and censoring regimes have long engaged in a cat-and-mouse game, leading to increasingly sophisticated Internet-scale censorship techniques and methods to evade them. In this work, we take a drastic departure from the previously manual evade/detect cycle by developing techniques to **automate the discovery of censorship evasion strategies**.

# Our Approach

We developed Geneva (*Gen*etic *Eva*sion), a novel genetic algorithm that evolves packet-manipulation-based censorship evasion strategies against nation-state level censors. Geneva re-derived virtually all previously published evasion strategies, and has discovered new ways of circumventing censorship in China, India, Iran, and Kazakhstan.

# How it works 

Geneva represents a _censorship evasion strategy_ as trees of packet modifications. Geneva composes four packet-level actions (drop, duplicate, fragment, tamper) together Geneva is a genetic algorithm
