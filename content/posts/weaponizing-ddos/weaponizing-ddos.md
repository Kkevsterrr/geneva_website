description: "Censors pose a threat to the entire Internet."
summary: "Censors pose an even greater threat to the Internet than previously understood. We demonstrate an off-path attack that exploits _residual censorship_, a feature by which a censor continues blocking traffic between two end-hosts for some time after a censorship event. Our attack sends spoofed packets with censored content, keeping two victim end-hosts separated by a censor from being able to communicate with one another. This attack allows anyone to weaponize censorship infrastructure to perform their own blocking."
