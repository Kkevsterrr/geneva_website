# Strategy Engine 
The Geneva engine—which runs the strategies that Geneva has discovered on network traffic—is open source and available at the link below. 
The engine allows anyone to test out existing strategies, write your own strategies, and evade censorship.

Currently, only Linux is supported. Windows support is in alpha.

We will be releasing Geneva's training code in the near future. To get updates, follow the project [on GitHub](http://github.com/kkevsterrr/geneva) or check back here.
