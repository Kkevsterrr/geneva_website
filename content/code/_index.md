# Geneva Source 
Geneva is open source and available [on our
Github](https://github.com/kkevsterrr/geneva). There are two main components:
the Geneva engine, which runs the strategies that Geneva has discovered on
network traffic, and the full genetic algorithm that powers Geneva.
This allows anyone to try out strategies we've published, write your own
strategies manually, or evolve new strategies against real world censors. 

See our documentation at [https://geneva.readthedocs.io](https://geneva.readthedocs.io).

Currently, only Linux is supported. Windows support is in alpha. To get updates, follow the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/kkevsterrr/geneva) or check back here.

**Disclaimer:** Geneva trains against a live adversary, so when running the genetic algorithm to evolve new censorship strategies, it will intentionally trigger censorship many times during training. Understand the risks of using Geneva in your country before trying it.
