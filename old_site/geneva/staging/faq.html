						<h2>Why not just use Tor?</h2>

						<div id="b_tor" class="container_indent">
								<p> Tor (onion routing) is a peer-to-peer
								system for achieving anonymous communication.
								At a high level, the idea is that, by
								forwarding encrypted data through a sequence of
								hops, a passive observer would not be able to
								determine who the two end-points of the
								communication are. Tor has become very popular
								and successful at avoiding some kinds of attacks.
								So successful, in fact, that some regions seek
								to <a
										href="https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-censorship-events.html">block
										all Tor traffic</a> altogether. </p>

								<p> There is some precedence for avoidance in
								Tor; it currently has a feature by which users
								can explicitly exclude certain countries from
								Tor's circuit construction algorithm, but
								unfortunately this does not preclude those
								countries from being on the path <i>between</i>
								two hops on the circuit. </p>
								
								<p> We believe Alibi Routing can
								<i>complement</i> Tor by choosing hops so that
								the entire end-to-end path avoids regions that
								users suspect are dropping Tor traffic. </p>

						<h2>How do you prove exactly where the packet went?</h2>

						<div id="b_knowroutes" class="container_indent">
								<p> Simple: we don't! </p>

								<p> Instead, we prove two things:
								<ol>
										<li> That the packet went through an overlay
										node (a peer).  This is proved by the
										peer signing (or more simply adding a
										MAC to) the packet.

										<li> That the round-trip time of the
										data (the time it takes to go from the
										source, through the relay, to the
										destination, and back) is less than the
										time it would have taken a packet to go
										through the relay <i>and</i> the
										forbidden region.

								</ol>

								So, in other words, we use the signature (or
								MAC) to know precisely one place in the world
								the packet <i>did</i> go, and we use end-to-end
								timing to figure out where else in the world it
								<i>could not</i> have gone.  </p>

						</div>
				</div>


				<div id="c_timing" class="container">
						<div class="vdivider_20"></div>
						<h2>How do you measure the minimal time it takes for a packet to travel?</h2>

						<div id="b_timing" class="container_indent">
								<p> One of the goals of Alibi Routing is to be
								able to work without having to actively measure
								the topology of the Internet, or even typical
								latencies on the Internet, as both of these
								could be manipulated by an active adversary. </p>

								<p> Instead, we make use of something that no
								adversary can manipulate: the fact that
								information cannot travel faster than the speed
								of light.  If we know that the shortest
								possible distance to get to <i>any</i> point in
								a forbidden region is <i>D</i>, then the
								shortest possible round-trip time through that
								point is 2*<i>D</i>/<i>c</i>. If we ever see a
								round-trip time less than this, then we know it
								could not have gone through the forbidden
								region. </p>

						</div>
				</div>


				<div id="c_speed" class="container">
						<div class="vdivider_20"></div>
						<h2>Is the speed of light enough to really factor into latencies?</h2>

						<div id="b_speed" class="container_indent">

								<p> Light (and information) can travel
								<i>really</i> fast: in one second, it could
								circle the world about 7.5 times. Over very
								short distances (e.g., two laptops in the same
								room), latencies are dominated by the time it
								takes the computers to process the data. </p>

								<p> But when considering longer paths -- paths
								that traverse countries, not just rooms -- the
								speed at which information can propagate does
								indeed play a large role.  For example, the
								minimum time it would take to cross the United
								States and return is about 32 milliseconds
								(assuming a distance of 3000 miles).  In
								Internet latencies, this is significant and
								easy for a program to measure. </p>

						<h2>Where can I download Alibi Routing?</h2>

						<div id="b_download" class="container_indent">

								<p> You can download the research prototype
							    at the <a href="/">Alibi Routing homepage</a>.
								We are actively working on an easier-to-use
								tool, and we hope to make it publicly available
								by the end of the year.  Stay tuned!
